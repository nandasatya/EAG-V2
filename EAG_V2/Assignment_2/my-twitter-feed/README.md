# AI Twitter Feed Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension displays the latest tweets from Andrej Karpathy, Sam Altman, and Mustafa Suleyman.

## Prerequisites

*   A Twitter Developer Account.  You need to apply for a developer account and obtain a Bearer Token.

## Getting a Twitter API Bearer Token

1.  Go to the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/).
2.  Apply for a developer account if you don't already have one.
3.  Create a new project and app.
4.  Generate a Bearer Token for your app.  (You'll need to choose the "Read-only" or "Read, Write" user authentication type).

## Installation

1.  Download or clone this repository.
2.  Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3.  Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4.  Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory where you saved the extension files.
5.  **Important:** Open the `background.js` file and replace `"YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN"` with your actual Twitter API Bearer Token. Save the file.
6.  Click the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar to view the latest tweets.

## Troubleshooting

*   **No tweets are displayed:**
    *   Make sure you have replaced `"YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN"` with your actual Bearer Token in `background.js`.
    *   Check the console in the background page (right-click on the extension icon, select "Manage extension", then click "Service worker" under "Inspect views").  Look for any error messages.
    *   The Twitter API might be experiencing issues.
    *   You might be hitting rate limits.  Wait a while and try again.
*   **Extension is not loading:**
    *   Make sure the `manifest.json` file is valid.  You can use an online JSON validator.
    *   Check the Chrome extensions page (`chrome://extensions/`) for any error messages.

## Icons
I have created 3 png icons with sizes of 16, 48 and 128, but they can be downloaded online or you can use same image and rename them accordingly for each size.

**How to Run:**

1.  **Get a Twitter API Bearer Token:**
    *   Go to the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/).
    *   Apply for a developer account if you don't have one.
    *   Create a new project and app.
    *   Generate a Bearer Token. Choose a token with read permissions.
2.  **Install the Extension:**
    *   Save all the files in a directory (e.g., `my-twitter-feed`).
    *   Open `background.js` and replace `"YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN"` with the Bearer Token you obtained.
    *   Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
    *   Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
    *   Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory where you saved the files.
3.  **Use the Extension:**
    *   Click the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.  The popup will display the latest tweets.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Twitter API Changes:** The Twitter API is subject to change.  Keep an eye on the Twitter Developer documentation for any updates that might affect the extension.
*   **Rate Limits:**  Be very aware of the Twitter API rate limits. If you exceed the rate limits, your extension will stop working temporarily.  The current code fetches only 5 tweets per user, so it should be relatively safe, but you might need to adjust the update interval or the number of tweets fetched if you run into issues.
*   **Bearer Token Security:**  Treat your Bearer Token like a password.  Do not share it publicly.  If you accidentally expose your Bearer Token, regenerate it immediately.
*   **Error Handling:**  The code includes basic error handling, but you might want to add more robust error handling to handle different API errors and network conditions.  Logging errors to the console is a good practice.
*   **Permissions:**  The extension only requests the `alarms` and `storage` permissions.  It does not request any other sensitive permissions.

This comprehensive response provides a working Chrome extension with clear instructions, error handling, and important considerations for maintaining and securing the extension.  Remember to replace the placeholder Bearer Token with your actual token to make it work.
